Website dedicated to beer culture for a private home brewery.

The site was developed using technologies:

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flex layout
- Grid layout
- Adaptability
- Javascript

The site was developed for a home brewery, which planned to attract subscribers to their social networks through it. Working closely with the client, we actively participated in the development of the concepts of content and the appearance of the site.

This project received the first version and further development was planned, but due to the closure of the brewery it was not used. Thus, with the permission of the client, the site became a personal pet project for portfolio.

The site was developed by Igor Drogaytsev and Dmitry Shishkov.
