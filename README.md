Website dedicated to beer culture for BOIZ brewery.

The site was developed for a home brewery, which planned to attract subscribers to their social networks through it. Working closely with the client, we with second developer actively participated in the development of the concepts of content, appearance of the site and code.

The following has been implemented so far:

- Main page with a block about the company and recordings of webinars
- Page with popular places of the world
- Page with an overview of varieties of the main product
- Page with the classification of sub products
- Online shop with cart and search filters for the goods

The site was developed using technologies:

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flex layout
- Grid layout
- Adaptability for mobile devices
- JS ES6
- Webpack
- Figma for creating logos and design

With the permission of the client, the site came to my personal portfolio.
